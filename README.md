## Description
A built-from-scratch Java program that predicts Vertebra Abnormalities using ML's Neural Network model.

The input features are:
1. Pelvic incidence
2. Pelvic tilt
3. Lumbar lordosis angle
4. Sacral slope
5. Pelvic radius
6. Degree of spondylolisthesis

The binary classifier's output is a confidence percentage of the abnormality, e.g.: 72% means that the neural network is 72% certain that an abnormaly exist.
